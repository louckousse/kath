# Mother Earth's blues

Based on an idea from [Paulloz](https://github.com/Paulloz)
---

The kind Mother Earth suffers because humans dry out her resources. She must get rid of them.
You have 5 natural weapons at your disposal to do so. Each one will strike randomly on the earth when you decide to. Obviously, each weapon have a reload time.
